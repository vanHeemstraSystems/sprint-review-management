Create Sprint Review Events in Microsoft Teams
===============================================

In Microsoft Teams, from the Calendar tab, choose "New event".

Make sure you select the calendar of the team you are creating a Sprint event for (e.g. Team IT 1: DS Cloud) which you created earlier.

Name the Daily Standup "Team" + blank space + "DEPARTMENT NAME" + "TEAM NUMBER" + ":" + blank space+ "SERVICE NAME" + blank space + "NICKNAME" + blank space + "-" + blank space + "Sprint Review".

Where:

- "DEPARTMENT NAME": the name of the department the team is part of, e.g. for "Information Technology" us "IT".
- "TEAM NUMBER": the number of the team for easy of distinguishing between teams.
- "SERVICE NAME": the service the department of which team is part of e.g. for "Developer Services" use "DS".
- "NICKNAME": the name the team uses to be called. For e.g. a Cloud-technology oriented team, use "Cloud".

Example: Team IT 1: DS Cloud - Sprint Review

Set the Start Date to the last day of the Sprint and set a Start and End Time somewhere during that working day (preferably lasting for no more than 30 minutes). Choose for the event to be a repeating event on a biweekly basis (if your Sprint runs for two weeks), either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. 

If the time of the Sprint Review does not change during Sprints, you can set the End Date to the very end of the last Sprint of the Year. Otherwise set the End Date to the last day of the last Sprint of the Quarter.

Note: This is NOT and "All day" event.

Recommended: Good practise is to hold your Sprint Review at the end of your Sprint.

See [Who leads the Sprint Review?](https://medium.com/@agilefreya/who-leads-the-sprint-review-6dec5907c1a6). Well, everyone.

"The Sprint Review is a working session and the Scrum Team should avoid limiting it to a presentation."

The Calendar Event of the Sprint Review could have directions to the physical meeting place or a link online meeting for ease of attending.
