Create Sprint Events in Microsoft Teams
========================================

In Microsoft Teams, from the Calendar tab, choose "New event".

Make sure you select the calendar of the team you are creating a Sprint event for (e.g. Team IT 1: DS Cloud) which you created earlier.

Name the Sprint "Sprint" + blank space + "YY" + "Q" + "NUMBER OF QUARTER" + "." + "NUMBER OF THE SPRINT WITHIN THE QUARTER" + blank space + "-" + "SERVICE NAME" + blank space + "NICKNAME".

Where:

- "YY": the second part of the year, e.g. for "2025" use "25".
- "NUMBER OF QUARTER": with 4 quarters per year, this number is either 1 (for first quarter), 2 (for second quarter), 3 (for third quarter), or 4 (for fourth quarter).
- "NUMBER OF THE SPRINT WITHIN THE QUARTER": for sprints running for two weeks, the number of sprints within a quarter are 6. So use the number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
- "SERVICE NAME": the service the department of which team is part of e.g. for "Developer Services" use "DS".
- "NICKNAME": the name the team uses to be called. For e.g. a Cloud-technology oriented team, use "Cloud".

Example: Sprint 25Q1.5 - DS Cloud

Choose the start and end date that matches the number of the sprint within the quarter.
